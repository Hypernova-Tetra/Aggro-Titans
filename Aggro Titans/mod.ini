Title="Aggro Titans - Supreme"
Version="Playtest"
Description="Restored and overhauled. Scrapped attacks and QTEs given full functionality hopefully with minimall issues. The ultimate Supreme experience that completely changes the fight. Had a lot of help with constructing this mod. Code implementations created by Holoska and Pikachu. Shoutout to various members of the HEMs such as Ashrindy, Holoksa, Gordon Ramsay, Elise, Nugget, and more for assitance in Dvscene editing, Hex Editing, overall help with figuring out how stuff works to get this mod rolling, and various suggestions to build this mod up to be the best it can be. Shoutout to BatmanSonic for this mod's code file to have option choices. Special thanks to Adel for guiding me through fixing an issue with having a custom model for Supreme to be able to get his wings in. Thanks to all my playtesters for this mod."
