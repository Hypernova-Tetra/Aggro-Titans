## Aggro-Titans V0.1.5
- Optimized certain QTEs related to Shoot02 and its variants across the mod to load quicker in the fight.
- Fixed Winglaser_2 QTE's second input auto failing due to incorrect timescale parameter.
- Changed Supreme's "immediateActions" or rather what the asm file calls "counterPose" animation.

## Aggro-Titans V0.1.4
- Rearranged files
- Adjusted Red Circle QTE on "Zev_Blow" for Fixed Vanilla option
- Small Adjustment to the "Winglaser_2" QTE (This is still being worked on)
- Added some effects to the QTE scene from file "test_qte_sample"
- Fixed incorrect Resource Pointer from "Zev_rfl_Sp02"
- Adjusted "bo6xxx.pac" for the Hyper Sonic skin option as it was an outdated version of what I used for the Monologue mod.
- "Zev_rfl_Shoot01" had an issue with Sonic being in the wrong spot when failing parts of the QTE. So this scene was updated with new fail scenes.
