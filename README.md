# Aggro Titans.

This mod aims to enhance the Titan boss experience. Up first is Supreme. Overtime a load of unused content was found and documented since its release. This mod aims to restore all possible unused content, hopefully with minimal issues. Had a lot of help with constructing this mod. Code implementations created by Holoska and Pikachu. Shoutout to various members of the HEMs such as Ashrindy, Gordon Ramsay, Elise, Nugget, and more for assistance in Dvscene editing, Hex Editing, overall help with figuring out how stuff works to get this mod rolling, and various suggestions to build this mod up to be the best it can be. Shoutout to BatmanSonic for this mod's code file to have option choices. Special thanks to Adel for guiding me through fixing an issue with having a custom model for Supreme to be able to get his wings in. Thanks to all my play testers for this mod. This mod comes in 2 flavors. "Enhanced" and "Combat Mods". The bosses remain the same as far as the attacks go, the only difference is HP, and in the "Combat Mods" setting, you can gain rings from using the Cyloop.
